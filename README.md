# Better Message Attachments
This is a simple theme addon for BetterDiscord, that fixes Discord stupid decision to have groups of images be sent in a column instead of in a grid formation.
This is the first theme I have made for BetterDiscord, any feedback or bug reports would be greatly appreciated!


# Installation for BetterDiscord
1) Download the file from here
2) Put it in your themes folder
3) Enable it from the themes tab, if it didn't enable automatically.


# Support and Suggestions
Found something that's broken?
Have an idea for ways it could be improved?
Or do you just need help with something?
Then please use the Issues tab as I don't accept friend requests or DMs on Discord from strangers, and I would much prefer to have everything collected in one spot right here on GitHub!

I hope that is understandable.


# Known Issues
Different sized images can make the layout look a little odd, I will happily take suggestions as to how that can be fixed while keeping everything tightly put together!
Images sent in multiple messages instead of one collected message will still show up as they normally do on Discord, I am not sure this is something I can fix due to the way messages are sent on Discord.
